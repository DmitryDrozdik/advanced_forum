#241982 by Michelle: Fixed install function for filling table so it doesn't give warnings and returns success/failure properly. Since it was filling the table even with the warnings, there's no need to rerun this.

Re-added advf-forum-repeat-post.tpl.php which somehow got dropped from cvs.

#241982 by Michelle (based on idea from Bdragon): Use a table to store reference to last posts in forum to replace the monster query.

advf-forum-submitted.tpl.php - Added an extra section for adding more info when a comment is the latest.
